The purpose of this plugin is to facilitate the implementation and framework for a True Multi-Room "Syncronized Audio <b>AND</b> Video Streaming solution for XBMC.
<br>
<br>
This is why I have chosen VLC as the program of choice for this effort. Not only does it support just about all audio and video formats very well but it provides the inherent capability to provide client/server streaming syncronization over the local network which means that no more "out-of-phase" audio issues for those of you that have more than one XBMC box in your home.<br>

<b>Update:  9/27/2010</b>

From here on out the MAV addon can be downloaded/updated and installed via the XBMC addons feature.<br>
