1.1.1
- Streamer IP Input Dialogue - Now set to type "text"

- Fixed default port number for http interface from 8081 to 8080.  The script would fail on intialization because it could not establish connection to 
  XBMC http interface.

1.1.0
- Added DVD Streaming 

- Support for RTP streaming

- SQL Backend

- Autoscan and configuration of Sources

- Background Signalling between Clients and Master via UDP

- Source Auto-Play

- Capability to Stream DVD's

1.0.9
VLC version 1.1.4 required (it's a better release anyhow!!! ;-) )
- Added Option for Master Syncronization (Because of this it is necessary to upgrade to vlc 1.1.4 on linux based systems)

- Added Stop Multiroom-AV to the list (this is a non editable item) It does what it says... it stops all streaming
  (BTW... I add this to my 'favorites' along with my sources)  ;-)

- Added Generate Files to the list for manually generating the scripts needed (this is a non editable item)
  NOTE: You should only run this after you have made a change to the plugin via "addon settings" and requires a restart of XBMC
        for the changes to go into effect.

- Souces in the list now play their respective streams when selected.

- Added Dynamic Playlist function when queuing songs (note: With Linux based xbmc's, that every song has to be individually selected)
  this is due to the continuous play issue that was reported with Linux (XBMC Bug:#10106).

- Fixed Loopback of audio/video when configured for Dedicated Master Streamer.

- Play local i.e. Loopback is now on by default.

- Fixed playercorefactory - set default hideconsole to "TRUE"

- To lessen confusion, sources can be started from the MAV console now "again" - you should still remember to add the .pls locations via
  appropriate Music / Video sections so you can access the source via a remote like "XBMC remote"
  
- Fixed no DVD playing (No DVD streaming at the moment)

- Fixed DOS windows popping up "annoyance" when generating files

- Added more context to the actual plugin (Dialogues, status, and messages) so you can see what is happeing

- Cleaned up some more code.


1.0.8
- Fixed issue for Windows based systems being both client and master

- Continuous "gappless" play added for streaming music/audio files for Windows

- Loopback as Master of playing media added for Windows based systems

- Notification added of starting Streaming Server when in Master mode and Start Streamer on Start is activated via the Addon Settings


1.0.4 - 1.0.7 (BETA) rc45
- Added support for ALL OS's

- Manual On-Demand Streaming of Audio and/or Video from client or master hosts.

- Eliminated need for xdotool and wmctrl application making the plugin OS agnostic.

- Added deletion, renaming of Source generated files when source is renamed or removed

- Added generation of .PLS files for use as shortcuts in user defined folder location via Addon Settings (Misc Setting Section). 
  With this feature, the user can define a folder which can then be added as a Music/Video source respively in the Music 
  and/or Video sections of XBMC

- Playing/Activating are now done via the generated PLS files located in the folder that you choose in the settings.  Once these are created
  you can create a shortcut to the folder location in either the Music and/or Video sections of XBMC using the "add source" in those sections.
  Note: As a result of this change/enhancement, the buttons for the AV sources in the MultiroomAV Plugin now only serve to De-Activate/Kill Streams (in or out)
  when selected and for management purposes such as Renaming, Removing, Editing parameters specific to the source.
